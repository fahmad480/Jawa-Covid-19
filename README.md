# Jawa-Covid-19
this is the project file "Covid-19 Java Island Interactive Chart" for the Spark AR Studio V89 application

## Inspiration
I got this inspiration from one of the covid19 development statistics on the internet and tried to make it in the form of augmented reality on Instagram using spark ar

## What it does
This ar will provide information related to the number of people who are confirmed, recovered and died of corona. I made 3 statistical forms, maps, bars and text charts

## How I built it
I use Java island map and convert it to 3D using the blender application, then I put the 3D file into spark ar and give a lot of logic in the form of patches and javascript

## Challenges I ran into
I have trouble adding a piece of content that can attract the user's attention, your input will be very meaningful for this project

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I can make this AR very perfect although it's a shame spark ar doesn't have the feature to retrieve data on the internet so that it can get data accurately and in real time

## What I learned
a lot, ranging from the development of covid19, chart form, and much more

## What's next for Covid-19 Java Island Interactive Chart
I will make a distribution map that is much broader, the next target is to make a map of Indonesia and divided into provincial units
